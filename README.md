# Iot-Based-Speech-Recognition-Robot

###Domain:
Internet of Things - Speech Recognition

### Description:
The implementation of speech recognition based robot performs motion through speech inputs as well as text inputs.

 This project gives an idea on working with a voice recognition software to control a robot, which can be further implemented for the semi-autonomous voice-controlled wheelchair in hospitals and other purposes.
